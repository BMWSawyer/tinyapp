# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The web application will allow users to register for an account, it will keep track of their shortened URLs and even after logging out and then back in again they will still have access the URLs that they shortened.

## Final Product

These are three screenshots of the web application in use. The first is the user registration page, the second is the URLs list page, and the third is the individual URL/URL edit page.
